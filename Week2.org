* Commit Directly

git commit -a -m ""

** Already tracked files
** Small changes
Impossible to explain extra information, than the flag -m


* Log

** git log
Show all log

** git show ID
The ID, from git log, can be used to see changes to specific commits.

# (Uncommitted checkpoint, to be read in ** Rollbacks context)

* Undoing Things

** Undoing Changes Before Committing
- deletion in stage

** Amending Commits
+ redoing

** Rollbacks

Sending a commit till this point (maked in *).
git commit -a -m "Regular update of notes, after a class" *

Rolling back till the comment, #, before the Undoing Things topic
git revert HEAD

Unsuccessful! But, no worries. We will learn in the next topic how to Rollback
further.
